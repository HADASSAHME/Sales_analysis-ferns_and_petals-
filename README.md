 ## VISUALIZATIONs

 ## TOOLS
 - Power Query ( Extraction, Transformation and Loading data)
 - Excel ( Analyzing the data by use of PIvot tables)

## PROCEDURE
- Data Extraction and Loading: this involed the use of power query to extract, transform(also included some form of cleaning) the data and also load it back into excel for further analysis.here, I used “joins” to combine the order and product column to  get the cumulative price.
- Data Modelling: with the use of data modeling, I established a relationship between orders, product and customers worksheet for easy analysis.
- Data Loading; using the load function , i loaded the extracted data back to excel for further analysis with the use of Pivot Tables.
